            2. Utilize a language graph to efficiently represent and process linguistic information, enabling complex 
            reasoning and knowledge integration.
            3. Incorporate RAG with language caching to enhance the system's ability to retrieve and utilize relevant 
            information efficiently.
            4. Develop a coordination mechanism for agent interaction, task delegation, and collaborative problem-solving.
